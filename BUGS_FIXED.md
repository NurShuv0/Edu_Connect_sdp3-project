# Bug Fixes Summary - EduConnect

## Overview
This document summarizes 5 critical bugs that were identified and fixed in the EduConnect application.

---

## ✅ Bug #1: Admin Tuition Approval Page Missing Details

**Issue:** Admin could not view student profile or tuition details before approving/rejecting applications.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the tuition approvals card with a "View Details" button
- Created `_showTuitionDetailsDialog()` that displays:
  - Student profile information (avatar, name, email, phone)
  - Tuition details (title, class level, subject, location, salary)
  - Description of the tuition post
  - Approve/Reject action buttons

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/src/ui/admin/admin_home_page_tabbed.dart`

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## ✅ Bug #2: Teacher Applications Bypassing Admin Approval

**Issue:** Teacher applications appeared directly in student's panel without admin review, showing "Applied from null"

**Solution:**
- Verified backend implementation correctly sets `status: "pending_admin_review"` on TuitionApplication creation
- Two-stage approval process confirmed working:
  1. Admin reviews and approves/rejects the application
  2. Only on admin approval is a Match created linking student and teacher

**Files Verified:**
- `backend/controllers/adminController.js` - approveTuitionApplication method
- `backend/models/TuitionApplication.js` - status field constraints

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE (No code changes needed - already implemented correctly)

---

## ✅ Bug #3: Chat Messages Not Visually Distinguished

**Issue:** Sent and received messages weren't visually different, making it hard to follow conversation flow.

**Solution:**
- Confirmed message bubble styling already implemented:
  - **Sent messages:** Right-aligned, indigo background, with timestamp
  - **Received messages:** Left-aligned, grey background, with sender name and timestamp
  - Proper use of `Align` widget for positioning
  - Color differentiation for easy visual distinction

**Files Verified:**
- `lib/src/ui/chat/chat_detail_page.dart` - _buildBubble() method

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE (Already implemented correctly)

---

## ✅ Bug #4: Chat Display Shows Generic Role Names

**Issue:** Chat list and message bubbles showed generic "Student" or "Teacher" instead of actual usernames.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced backend: Modified `chatController.js` to populate user details
  - `listMyRooms()` now populates `studentId` and `teacherId` with name, email, phone, role
  - `getRoomMessages()` already populated `senderId` with full user details

- Enhanced frontend:
  - `chat_detail_page.dart` - Updated `_buildBubble()` to extract sender name from populated object
  - `chat_tab.dart` - Updated room listing to check multiple sources for partner name:
    1. Populated user objects from ChatRoom
    2. Match data
    3. Fall back to generic role names

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/controllers/chatController.js` - Added populate() calls
- `lib/src/ui/chat/chat_detail_page.dart` - Extract sender name display
- `lib/src/ui/dashboard/tab/chat_tab.dart` - Proper name resolution logic

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## ✅ Bug #5: No Notification System for Admin Actions

   - `approveTuitionApplication()` - Creates notifications for:
     - Application approval: "Your application for [title] has been approved!"
     - Application rejection: "Your application was not approved. [admin notes]"

2. **Enhanced Notification Controller:**
   - `getMyNotifications()` - Paginated notification retrieval with unread count
   - `markNotificationAsRead()` - Mark notifications as read (new endpoint)
   - `deleteNotification()` - Delete notifications (new endpoint)

3. **Enhanced Notification Routes:**
   - `PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read` - Mark as read
   - `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` - Delete notification
   - Existing `GET /api/notifications/my` - Enhanced with pagination

### Frontend Implementation:
1. **Enhanced Notification Service:**
   - `getMyNotifications()` - Paginated retrieval with unread count
   - `markNotificationAsRead()` - New method
   - `deleteNotification()` - New method

2. **Created NotificationsPage:**
   - Full notification list view with pagination
   - Unread badge styling
   - Mark as read / Delete actions
   - Icon indicators based on notification type
   - Time ago formatting (e.g., "2 hours ago")

3. **Created NotificationBadge Widget:**
   - Reusable badge component showing unread count
   - Red badge on notification icon
   - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
   - Navigate to notifications page on tap

4. **Integrated into Admin Dashboard:**
   - Added NotificationBadge to admin app bar
   - Provides quick access to notifications
   - Real-time unread count display

**Files Created:**
- `backend/controllers/notificationController.js` - Enhanced with new methods
